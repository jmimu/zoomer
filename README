zoomer: view and click pictures

zoomer is used to look at several successive pictures (from a movie
for example), and find one particular point on a particular image.


compiling (needs QT 4.4 or more):
	
	qmake
	make
	
running:
	
	./zoomer

zoomer reads the configuration file "zoomer.xml", and writes the changes to it.

If the configuration file is not found, zoomer creates an example one,
where you can see the structure of datas.
